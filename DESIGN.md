# Design conventions

Reference for the patterns already established in `content-hub-firebase.html`. Follow these when adding new fields, panels, or icons so the app keeps reading as one system rather than accreting one-off styles. This is documentation only — it doesn't run; edit the source file and regenerate `index.html` as usual.

## Colors

All color is driven by CSS custom properties on `:root`, with dark as the default and explicit overrides for `:root[data-theme="dark"]` / `:root[data-theme="light"]` (set by the manual theme toggle, persisted to localStorage). Never hardcode a hex color in a new rule — use the existing tokens:

- `--brand`, `--brand-soft`, `--brand-gradient-h` — MediaShock orange, used for active states, primary buttons, links, focus rings.
- `--surface`, `--surface-alt` — card/modal background vs. sunken field background.
- `--border` — all hairlines and input borders.
- `--text`, `--text-soft`, `--text-faint` — primary copy, field labels, secondary/meta text (in that descending order of emphasis).
- `--danger`, `--danger-soft`, `--good`, `--bad` — status colors (delete actions, goal pacing, etc.)

## Spacing rhythm

Three tiers, used consistently everywhere a label sits above a field or a group of fields sits above another group:

- **Label → field: `0.35rem`** (`.field-col`, and the gap baked into `#postForm label`/`#ideaForm label`). Never let a label sit as a bare sibling of its field — always wrap it in `.field-col` so it picks up this tight gap instead of a section gap.
- **Within a section: `0.9rem`** (`.form-section`'s own gap) — spacing between fields that belong to the same logical group.
- **Between sections: divider + `1.3rem`** (`.form-section + .form-section`, `.form-section + .modal-actions`) — a hairline `border-top` plus `1.1rem` padding-top, so unrelated groups of fields read as visually distinct blocks instead of one long stack.

## Form sections

The Post and Idea modals are each broken into `.form-section` blocks, each with a `.form-section-label` (small uppercase eyebrow, `0.68rem`, `--text-faint`, `letter-spacing: 0.05em`) naming the group: e.g. Details, People & Tasks, Content (Post) / Details, Tasks, Brief, Stage & Feedback (Idea). When adding a new field to one of these modals, put it in the section it semantically belongs to rather than appending it to the end — that's what keeps the form scannable as it grows. If a new concern doesn't fit an existing section, give it its own `.form-section` with a short (1-2 word) label rather than leaving it bare.

## Icons

All icon-only buttons are inline SVG, not emoji or icon fonts: `stroke="currentColor"`, `fill="none"`, `stroke-width="1.8"` (bump to ~`2.6` only for small badge-style icons that need to read at a glance), `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`, rendered at `16x16`. Wrap them in `.icon-btn` (2.1rem square, 1px border, 8px radius, `--surface` background) for a clickable icon, or a variant like `.emoji-inline-btn` when it needs to sit inside/overlay another field.

## Reusable input patterns

- **Chips-with-add-row**: owners use `createOwnerChipInput(inputEl, chipsEl, onChange)` — a small factory returning `{add, set, get}`. Reuse this factory (don't hand-roll a new chip list) for anything that's "add a short label, show it as a removable pill."
- **Checklist-with-assignee**: tasks use `createTaskListInput(listEl, inputEl, assigneeSelectEl, getOwners)` similarly — checkbox + text + avatar + remove, assignee dropdown synced live to the item's current owners.
- **Emoji picker**: `createEmojiPicker(toggleBtn, pickerEl, tabsEl, gridEl, textarea, onInsert)` — instantiate one per textarea that should support inserting an emoji (Post Copy, Idea/Brief). The trigger button lives inside a `.textarea-emoji-wrap` (position: relative wrapper around the textarea), overlaid bottom-right via `.emoji-inline-btn`, so it reads as part of the text field rather than a separate toolbar action.
- **Avatars**: `avatarHtml(name, sizeClass)` — always derive color and initials from `avatarColorFor(name)` / `getInitials(name)`, both hashing the trimmed/lowercased name, so the same person renders identically everywhere in the app. Never assign an avatar color ad hoc.
- **Image links**: both Post and Idea images are entered as pasted URLs (`.image-link-row` input + Add button, `.image-link-grid` of `.image-thumb` tiles with a `.image-remove` button), not uploaded files — deliberately. Firestore documents have a hard 1MiB limit, and embedding uploaded images as base64 forced heavy compression that was visibly pixelated; a URL is a few bytes regardless of the source image's real quality. A thumb gets `.broken` (via the `<img>`'s `error` event) when its URL doesn't load — note `.image-thumb.broken::after`'s decorative placeholder icon must keep `pointer-events: none`, or it silently eats clicks meant for the remove button underneath it. (Idea's version of this predates Post's and still uses its own `.idea-image-*` class names with identical rules — a future cleanup could merge them, but they aren't currently unified.)

## Schema changes

Any new field on `posts`/`ideas` must be additive and read with a fallback (`post.newField || defaultValue`) — existing documents without it should degrade gracefully, never break. See `normalizedGoal()` for the pattern used when a field's *shape* changes, not just its presence.
